## Content Originality Standards

### Original Content Requirements

#### ✅ ACCEPTABLE: Original Content
```markdown
# AI-Generated with Original Insights
Content generated by Gemini API that:
- Provides unique explanations
- Uses original examples
- Offers fresh perspectives
- Synthesizes information uniquely
- Adds original commentary

# Original Code Examples
def calculate_fibonacci(n):
    """Calculate nth Fibonacci number."""
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return calculate_fibonacci(n-1) + calculate_fibonacci(n-2)

# Properly Attributed Quotes
As stated in the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/):
> "Python is an interpreted, high-level programming language."

# Fair Use Commentary
The official Docker documentation suggests X, however in 
production environments, I've found Y works better because...
```

#### ❌ UNACCEPTABLE: Plagiarized Content
```markdown
# Direct copying without attribution
[Large blocks of text copied from Stack Overflow, Medium, 
or other sources without any citation]

# Paraphrased without attribution
[Content that closely follows another source's structure 
and arguments without giving credit]

# Code copied without attribution
# This is from Stack Overflow answer 12345 but no credit given
def some_function():
    # Exact code from elsewhere
    pass

# Misleading presentation
[Presenting others' work as if it were original insights]
```

---

## Licensing Compliance

### Open Source License Analysis

#### Python Dependencies Review
```python
# requirements.txt licensing assessment

✅ COMPATIBLE: Permissive licenses
google-generativeai  # Apache 2.0 - OK
requests             # Apache 2.0 - OK
python-dotenv        # BSD - OK

⚠️ REVIEW NEEDED: Copyleft licenses
some-library         # GPL-3.0 - Requires review
                     # May require source disclosure

❌ INCOMPATIBLE: Proprietary or restrictive
proprietary-lib      # Custom restrictive license
                     # Cannot be used
```

#### License Categories

**Permissive Licenses (Generally Safe):**
- MIT
- Apache 2.0
- BSD (2-Clause, 3-Clause)
- ISC
- Unlicense
- CC0

**Weak Copyleft (Usually Safe):**
- LGPL-2.1
- LGPL-3.0
- MPL-2.0
- EPL-2.0

**Strong Copyleft (Requires Review):**
- GPL-2.0
- GPL-3.0
- AGPL-3.0

**Proprietary/Custom (Requires Legal Review):**
- Custom licenses
- Commercial licenses
- Restrictive terms

---

## Attribution Requirements

### When Attribution is Required

#### 1. Direct Quotes
```markdown
✅ CORRECT: Attributed quote
According to the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/):
> "Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can 
> create and manage in Kubernetes."

❌ INCORRECT: Unattributed quote
Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can 
create and manage in Kubernetes.
```

#### 2. Code Snippets from External Sources
```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Attributed code
# Adapted from: https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html
import asyncio

async def main():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)

# ❌ INCORRECT: No attribution for copied code
import asyncio

async def main():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
```

#### 3. Ideas and Concepts
```markdown
✅ CORRECT: Attributed concept
Martin Fowler's [Strangler Fig pattern](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerFigApplication.html) 
suggests gradually replacing legacy systems by...

❌ INCORRECT: Unattributed concept
The strangler fig pattern suggests gradually replacing legacy 
systems by... [No mention of Martin Fowler]
```

#### 4. Statistics and Data
```markdown
✅ CORRECT: Attributed data
According to [Stack Overflow's 2024 Developer Survey](link), 
Python is used by 51% of professional developers.

❌ INCORRECT: Unattributed data
Python is used by 51% of professional developers.
```

---

## Fair Use Guidelines

### Educational Fair Use

#### ✅ ACCEPTABLE Fair Use
```markdown
# Brief quotations for educational purposes
This approach contrasts with what the Docker documentation 
recommends. The docs state: "[brief quote]". However, in 
practice, I've found [original analysis].

# Transformative commentary
The official approach is X, but here's why approach Y might 
work better in production environments: [original insights]

# Critical analysis
Many tutorials suggest X, but this has limitations: 
[original critical analysis]
```

#### ❌ NOT Fair Use
```markdown
# Republishing entire articles
[Copying entire blog posts or documentation sections]

# Minimal transformation
[Slightly rewriting someone else's content without adding value]

# Commercial harm
[Reproducing content that substitutes for the original]
```

---

## Plagiarism Detection

### Red Flags for Manual Review

#### Content-Level Red Flags
```
⚠️ Check if content:
- Matches existing articles too closely
- Has inconsistent writing style within post
- Contains unexplained jargon or acronyms
- Has abrupt topic transitions
- Lacks original examples or insights
- Follows common tutorial structures exactly
```

#### Code-Level Red Flags
```python
⚠️ Check if code:
- Matches Stack Overflow answers exactly
- Has inconsistent coding styles
- Contains unexplained "magic numbers"
- Includes commented-out code from elsewhere
- Has generic variable names (foo, bar, temp)
- Lacks context or explanation
```

### Verification Process
```
For suspicious content:
1. Search key phrases in quotes on Google
2. Check common sources (Stack Overflow, Medium, Dev.to)
3. Review code on GitHub search
4. Verify against official documentation
5. Check if structure matches popular tutorials
```

## AI-Generated Content Compliance

### Gemini API Generated Content

#### Guidelines for AI Content
```markdown
✅ ACCEPTABLE: AI-generated but original
- Unique explanations and examples
- Original code implementations
- Fresh perspectives on topics
- Synthesized information with new insights
- Properly attributed when referencing sources

⚠️ REVIEW NEEDED: Potential concerns
- Very generic content that could match many sources
- Code that exactly matches common patterns
- Explanations that mirror official docs
- Check if AI memorized and reproduced content

❌ UNACCEPTABLE: AI plagiarism
- AI reproducing copyrighted text verbatim
- AI copying code without attribution
- AI paraphrasing without adding value
```

#### AI Content Disclosure
```yaml
# Blog post front matter
---
title: "Post Title"
author: Tech Blog Automation
ai_assisted: true  # Optional disclosure
generation_method: "Google Gemini API"
---
```

---

## License Compatibility Matrix

### Common Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Apache 2.0 Dependencies
```
✅ Compatible with:
- Blog content (original)
- MIT licensed code
- Other Apache 2.0 code
- BSD licensed code

Requirements:
- Include Apache 2.0 license in NOTICES
- Preserve copyright notices
```

#### Scenario 2: GPL Dependencies
```
⚠️ Requires careful review:
- May trigger copyleft requirements
- May require source disclosure
- May affect license of derived works

Action:
- Avoid GPL dependencies if possible
- Consult legal if necessary
- Use permissive alternatives
```

## Attribution Best Practices

### Documentation Attribution
```markdown
# ✅ GOOD: Clear attribution
This section references the official [Python asyncio documentation]
(https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html), specifically 
the section on event loops.

# ✅ GOOD: Code attribution
# Based on example from Python docs:
# https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html#example-hello-world
import asyncio

async def main():
    print("Hello World")

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Link Attribution
```markdown
# ✅ GOOD: Inline citations
According to [Smith et al., 2024](url), this approach...

For more details, see [Docker's official guide](url).

# ✅ GOOD: Bibliography section
## References
1. Python Documentation - asyncio: https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html
2. Docker Documentation: https://docs.docker.com/
```
